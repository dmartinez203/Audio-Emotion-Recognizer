  <h1>Final Open-Ended Neural Network Project</h1>
  <p>Introduction to Neural Networks &mdash; Senior Computer Science Project (10-Day Timeline)</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is your <strong>last project</strong> in the Introduction to Neural Networks course. 
      The goal is to take a step beyond what we have covered in class and demonstrate that you can 
      <span class="highlight">explore, understand, and apply a new neural network or deep learning approach independently</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a type of neural network (or deep learning method) that was <strong>not covered</strong> in our lectures or labs.</li>
      <li>Identify a realistic problem or challenge whose solution can reasonably involve that model.</li>
      <li>Conduct a brief research investigation to understand the method and related prior work.</li>
      <li>Implement a minimal but working prototype and evaluate it on data.</li>
      <li>Summarize your work clearly in a written report and a short demo/presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> This project is intentionally open-ended. You are not expected to build a production system. 
      The focus is on learning something new, reasoning about its capabilities, and demonstrating a functioning proof-of-concept.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Core Requirements</h2>
    <h3>2.1 New Architecture / Method</h3>
    <p>
      Your project must be centered on a <strong>type of neural network or deep learning algorithm that we have not studied in class</strong>. 
      Examples <em>(only if they were not previously covered)</em> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transformers (for text, images, or time series)</li>
      <li>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</li>
      <li>Attention-based sequence models beyond standard RNNs/LSTMs</li>
      <li>Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders</li>
      <li>GAN variants (e.g., StyleGAN, CycleGAN) with a specific application</li>
      <li>Diffusion models for image or signal generation</li>
      <li>Capsule Networks</li>
      <li>Spiking Neural Networks</li>
      <li>Neural ODEs or other specialized architectures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are unsure whether a candidate method qualifies as “not covered,” choose an approach that is clearly outside the examples and material used in class.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Problem or Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      You must identify a <strong>problem or challenge</strong> whose solution can reasonably be framed as a neural network or deep learning task. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predicting something from structured or time-series data (e.g., anomaly detection, demand forecasting, health indicators).</li>
      <li>Classifying, generating, or transforming text (e.g., summarization, style transfer, code completion).</li>
      <li>Working with images or video (e.g., super-resolution, segmentation, denoising, simple generative art).</li>
      <li>Recommender-style tasks (e.g., basic personalized suggestions from small datasets).</li>
      <li>Small-scale scientific, game, or simulation problems that map naturally to a model you select.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Keep the scope practical: a problem that can be addressed with a <strong>small or medium dataset</strong> and a 
      <strong>simple prototype</strong> is better than an overly ambitious topic that cannot be completed in 10 days.
    </div>

    <h3>2.3 Research Component</h3>
    <p>
      Your project must include a clear research element:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read and reference at least <strong>2–3 credible sources</strong> (research papers, surveys, or technical articles) about your chosen method.</li>
      <li>Summarize what is known: strengths, limitations, and typical use cases.</li>
      <li>Explain why this method is appropriate (or at least plausible) for the problem you selected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not a literature review course, but you do need to demonstrate that you engaged with existing work instead of treating this as a random coding exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Suggested Directions (Not Mandatory)</h2>
    <p>
      The following are ideas to spark your thinking. You are free to pursue something entirely different as long as it fits the requirements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Transformers for Time-Series Forecasting:</span> 
        Use a simplified transformer model to predict a short time-series (stock prices, sensor data, or energy usage) and compare it against a simple baseline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Graph Neural Networks for Small Networks:</span> 
        Model a small social network, citation network, or user–item graph and try node classification or link prediction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction or Denoising:</span> 
        Use an autoencoder to compress and reconstruct images or tabular data, or to denoise noisy samples.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">GAN or Diffusion for Simple Image Generation:</span> 
        Train a basic GAN or diffusion model on a small, well-curated set of images (e.g., handwritten digits or icons) and show what it learns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Capsule Networks or Spiking Networks:</span> 
        Explore how these architectures handle a small classification task and report what you observe compared to standard CNNs or MLPs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Neural ODEs or Physics-Informed Models:</span> 
        Use a neural ODE or related approach to model a very simple dynamical system (e.g., a damped oscillator) and compare to standard numerical methods.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. 10-Day Suggested Timeline</h2>
    <p>This is a suggested schedule to keep the project manageable within 10 days. Adjust as needed, but do not leave everything for the last two days.</p>
    <ol class="timeline">
      <li><strong>Day 1–2:</strong> Choose your architecture and problem. Skim several sources and lock in your topic.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 3–4:</strong> Do focused reading. Take notes on how the method works and typical implementations. Collect or prepare your dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 5–6:</strong> Implement a first working version (even if small). Get a model running end-to-end on a subset of your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 7–8:</strong> Improve training and evaluation. Add basic metrics, plots, and comparisons to a simple baseline if possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 9:</strong> Write the first full draft of your report and prepare your demo (notebook, script, or slides).</li>
      <li><strong>Day 10:</strong> Polish everything. Make sure your code runs from start to finish, your report is coherent, and your demo is ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="note">
      Aim for <strong>complete and modest</strong> rather than incomplete and ambitious. A small, well-explained experiment is enough.
    </div>

    <h2>6. Advice for a Successful Project</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Pick something narrow and concrete.</span> 
        A small, clearly defined problem is better than trying to “solve everything” with a fancy model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Start with an existing implementation.</span> 
        It is acceptable to adapt open-source examples or tutorials, as long as you understand the code and clearly credit your sources. 
        Your contribution should be in <em>adapting, experimenting, and explaining</em>, not just copying.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Treat baselines seriously.</span> 
        If you can, compare your advanced model with a simple baseline (e.g., logistic regression, a small MLP, or a basic non-neural method). 
        This shows whether the extra complexity is justified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Expect some frustration.</span> 
        New architectures often come with messy details (e.g., shapes, training stability). 
        Keep notes on what breaks and how you fix it; this is part of what you will discuss in your report.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Document as you go.</span> 
        Don’t wait until the end to write your report. Capture decisions, errors, and insights throughout the 10 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="inline-heading">Respect the time limit.</span> 
        If something is taking too long, reduce the scope: smaller dataset, fewer training epochs, or a simpler variant of the architecture.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. What This Project Is Really Testing</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment is not about who can train the largest model or get the highest accuracy. 
      It is about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your ability to <strong>explore a new neural network or deep learning idea independently</strong>.</li>
      <li>Your ability to <strong>formulate and scope a problem</strong> that is appropriate for that method.</li>
      <li>Your ability to <strong>connect research reading to implementation</strong> and reflect on what you observe.</li>
      <li>Your ability to <strong>communicate technical work</strong> clearly, honestly, and concisely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Treat this as a small-scale rehearsal of what real-world work and research look like: 
      defining a problem, finding tools, experimenting, and explaining your choices.
