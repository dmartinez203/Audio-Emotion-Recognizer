# 🚀 QUICK START - Lambda Labs Training

## Upload & Run (3 Steps)

1. **Upload** `Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Notebook.ipynb` to Lambda Labs
2. **Click** "Run All Cells" (or Ctrl+Shift+Enter)  
3. **Wait** ~1-2 hours → **DONE!** ✅

## What Happens Automatically

✅ Install all packages (TensorFlow, librosa, etc.)  
✅ Download RAVDESS dataset (1.4 GB)  
✅ Train CNN model (50 epochs, ~30 min)  
✅ Train CNN-LSTM model (50 epochs, ~60 min)  
✅ Train YAMNet model (100 epochs, ~15 min)  
✅ Generate confusion matrices  
✅ Export all results & models

## Expected Results

| Model | Accuracy | Time |
|-------|----------|------|
| CNN | 65-75% | 30m |
| CNN-LSTM | 68-78% | 60m |
| **YAMNet** | **75-85%** | 15m |

**Best**: YAMNet (75-85%)

## Files to Download

**Required:**
- `Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Notebook.ipynb` (with outputs)
- `training_summary.txt`
- `final_comparison_all_models.png`

**Optional:**
- All `.h5` model files
- `training_results.json`

---

## Troubleshooting

**Out of Memory?** → Reduce batch size to 16 in Cell 3  
**No GPU?** → Check Cell 1 output for "GPU detected"  
**Download fails?** → Manual download from Zenodo link in Cell 3
