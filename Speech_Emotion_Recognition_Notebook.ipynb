    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements and compares three deep learning approaches for automatic speech emotion recognition (SER): a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, and transfer learning with YAMNet. Using the RAVDESS dataset containing 1,440 emotional speech recordings across 8 emotion classes, we achieve robust classification performance through mel-spectrogram feature extraction and supervised learning. The project demonstrates the comparative effectiveness of spatial feature learning (CNN), temporal-spatial modeling (CNN-LSTM), and transfer learning approaches for audio emotion classification tasks.\n",

    "## 1. Problem Statement and Quantitative Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Develop an automated system to classify human emotions from speech audio recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an audio signal $x(t)$ representing a speech utterance of duration $T = 3$ seconds sampled at $f_s = 16$ kHz, the goal is to learn a mapping function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{C}$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S = f_s \\times T = 48,000$ samples (raw waveform dimensionality)\n",
    "- $C = 8$ emotion classes: {neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised}\n",
    "- $f$ is parameterized by deep neural networks with learnable weights $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification task is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{c \\in \\{1,...,C\\}} P(y=c | x; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(y=c | x; \\theta)$ represents the predicted probability distribution over emotion classes given input $x$ and model parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than operating directly on raw waveforms, we transform audio into mel-spectrograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times T'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $M = 128$ mel-frequency bins\n",
    "- $T' = \\lceil S / h \\rceil = 188$ time frames (with hop length $h = 256$)\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces dimensionality from 48,000 to 24,064 features while preserving perceptually-relevant acoustic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss over $N$ training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{i,c} \\log(P(y=c | x_i; \\theta))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{i,c}$ is a one-hot encoded vector indicating the true emotion class for sample $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Importance and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Problem Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Human-Computer Interaction:** Emotion-aware systems enable more natural and empathetic AI assistants, improving user experience in customer service, healthcare, and education\n",
    "2. **Mental Health:** Automated emotion detection can support clinical assessment of depression, anxiety, and PTSD through speech analysis\n",
    "3. **Accessibility:** Helps individuals with autism spectrum disorder or social communication difficulties by providing real-time emotional feedback\n",
    "4. **Safety:** Driver emotion monitoring systems can detect fatigue, stress, or road rage to prevent accidents\n",
    "5. **Market Research:** Analyzing customer emotions during calls provides insights for product improvement and service quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Healthcare providers using telehealth platforms\n",
    "- Automotive manufacturers developing driver monitoring systems\n",
    "- Technology companies building conversational AI\n",
    "- Call center operations seeking quality assurance\n",
    "- Researchers in affective computing and psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- High inter-speaker variability (accent, pitch, speaking rate)\n",
    "- Contextual ambiguity (same words, different emotions)\n",
    "- Cultural differences in emotional expression\n",
    "- Limited labeled training data\n",
    "- Real-world noise and acoustic conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Deep Learning Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** Treats mel-spectrograms as 2D images, learning spatial patterns across frequency and time\n",
    "2. **CNN-LSTM Hybrid:** Combines CNN feature extraction with LSTM temporal modeling to capture sequential dependencies\n",
    "3. **Transfer Learning (YAMNet):** Leverages pretrained audio embeddings from AudioSet (2M+ clips) for robust feature representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software Stack:**\n",
    "- **TensorFlow 2.13.1 / Keras:** Deep learning framework\n",
    "- **Librosa:** Audio processing and feature extraction\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn:** Data splitting and evaluation metrics\n",
    "- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "- Accuracy: Overall classification correctness\n",
    "- Weighted F1-Score: Accounts for class imbalance\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix: Per-class error analysis\n",
    "- Precision/Recall: Class-specific performance\n",

    "**Source:** Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song  \n",
    "**URL:** https://zenodo.org/record/1188976  \n",
    "**Total Samples:** 1,440 audio files (speech-only subset)  \n",
    "**Format:** WAV files, originally 48 kHz, 16-bit  \n",
    "**Actors:** 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female)  \n",
    "**Recording:** Controlled studio environment with professional equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emotion Classes (8 total):**\n",
    "1. Neutral (baseline emotional state)\n",
    "2. Calm (low arousal, positive/neutral valence)\n",
    "3. Happy (high arousal, positive valence)\n",
    "4. Sad (low arousal, negative valence)\n",
    "5. Angry (high arousal, negative valence)\n",
    "6. Fearful (high arousal, negative valence)\n",
    "7. Disgust (moderate arousal, negative valence)\n",
    "8. Surprised (high arousal, neutral valence)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filename Encoding:** Each filename encodes metadata:\n",
    "- Format: `Modality-VocalChannel-Emotion-Intensity-Statement-Repetition-Actor.wav`\n",
    "- Example: `03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav` = fearful emotion from actor 12\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements:** Each actor recorded two sentences:\n",
    "- \"Kids are talking by the door\"\n",
    "- \"Dogs are sitting by the door\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emotional Intensity:** Two levels recorded:\n",
    "- Normal intensity\n",
    "- Strong intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why This Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **High Quality:** Professional recordings in controlled acoustic environment eliminate background noise\n",
    "- **Balanced:** Equal representation across actors and emotions prevents class bias\n",
    "- **Standardized:** Fixed sentences allow focus on emotional prosody rather than semantic content\n",
    "- **Validated:** Widely used benchmark with published baseline results for comparison\n",
    "- **Diversity:** Multiple speakers provide speaker-independent generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Acted Emotions:** Professional actors may not perfectly represent natural emotional expression\n",
    "- **Limited Context:** Single sentences lack conversational context found in real interactions\n",
    "- **Cultural Bias:** North American English speakers may not generalize to other languages/cultures\n",

    "### 2.3 Data Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Audio Loading and Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Load WAV files and standardize sampling rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wav, _ = librosa.load(file_path, sr=16000, mono=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Original 48 kHz downsampled to 16 kHz reduces computational cost by 66%\n",
    "- 16 kHz preserves speech frequencies (human voice: 85-255 Hz fundamental, up to 8 kHz for fricatives)\n",
    "- Mono conversion eliminates stereo channel redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Operation:**\n",
    "$$x_{16k}[n] = x_{48k}[3n], \\quad n = 0, 1, ..., \\lfloor N_{48k}/3 \\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Duration Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Standardize all clips to fixed 3-second duration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "- **Padding (if short):** Append zeros: $x_{padded} = [x[0], ..., x[N-1], 0, ..., 0]$\n",
    "- **Trimming (if long):** Truncate: $x_{trimmed} = x[0:S]$ where $S = 48,000$ samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Neural networks require fixed input dimensions\n",
    "- 3 seconds captures complete emotional utterances in RAVDESS\n",
    "- Zero-padding in frequency domain has minimal impact after mel transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Feature Extraction - Mel-Spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Transform time-domain waveform to time-frequency representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3a. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X[k, m] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n + mH] \\cdot w[n] \\cdot e^{-j2\\pi kn/N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $k$ = frequency bin index (0 to $N/2$)\n",
    "- $m$ = time frame index\n",
    "- $H = 256$ = hop length (samples between frames)\n",
    "- $w[n]$ = Hann window of length $N = 1024$\n",
    "- $x[n]$ = input waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "**3b. Power Spectrogram:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P[k, m] = |X[k, m]|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3c. Mel Filter Bank:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The mel scale approximates human auditory perception using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = 2595 \\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{f}{700}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is frequency in Hz and $m$ is mel frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply $M = 128$ triangular filters $H_i(k)$ spanning 0-8000 Hz:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{mel}[i, m] = \\sum_{k} P[k, m] \\cdot H_i(k), \\quad i = 1, ..., 128$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3d. Logarithmic Compression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{dB}[i, m] = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{S_{mel}[i, m]}{\\text{max}(S_{mel})}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Shape:** $(128, 188)$ → 128 mel bins × 188 time frames\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `n_mels=128`: Number of mel frequency bands\n",
    "- `n_fft=1024`: FFT window size (64ms at 16kHz)\n",
    "- `hop_length=256`: Frame shift (16ms at 16kHz)\n",
    "- `window='hann'`: Window function for spectral smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Mel scale matches human perception (we hear logarithmically)\n",
    "- Time-frequency representation captures both harmonic structure and temporal dynamics\n",
    "- 128 bins provide sufficient spectral resolution while remaining computationally tractable\n",
    "- dB scale compresses dynamic range for better neural network convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Scale features to [0, 1] range for stable neural network training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Per-Sample Min-Max Normalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{norm}[i, m] = \\frac{X[i, m] - \\min(X)}{\\max(X) - \\min(X) + \\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}$ prevents division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- **Per-sample** normalization handles variable recording volumes across actors\n",
    "- Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients during backpropagation\n",
    "- Sigmoid/tanh activations work best with inputs near 0\n",
    "- BatchNormalization layers benefit from pre-normalized inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Considered:** Dataset-level standardization $(X - \\mu) / \\sigma$ was not used because:\n",
    "- Requires multiple passes over data to compute global statistics\n",
    "- Less robust to distribution shifts in deployment\n",
    "- Per-sample normalization provides stronger invariance to volume\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Data Cleaning and Quality Assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Values:**\n",
    "- **Assessment:** No missing values detected in RAVDESS\n",
    "- **Verification:** All 1,440 files successfully loaded\n",
    "- **Handling Strategy:** If files were corrupted, they would be logged and excluded from training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers:**\n",
    "- **Detection:** Audio amplitude outliers are inherently bounded by 16-bit WAV format ([-32768, 32767])\n",
    "- **Handling:** Min-max normalization maps all values to [0, 1], effectively handling outliers\n",
    "- **Verification:** No silent files (all have non-zero energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality Checks:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Implemented in build_metadata_table()\n",
    "- File existence verification\n",
    "- WAV format validation via librosa.load()\n",
    "- Duration sanity checks (all files 2-4 seconds)\n",
    "- Label extraction success (all filenames parse correctly)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale for No Additional Cleaning:**\n",
    "- Professional studio recordings → no background noise\n",
    "- Controlled recording conditions → no clipping or distortion\n",
    "- Standardized protocol → consistent quality across samples\n",
    "- Validation study confirmed perceptual clarity of all recordings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Data Splitting Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified Train-Validation-Test Split:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training:** 70% (1,008 samples) - model learning\n",
    "- **Validation:** 15% (216 samples) - hyperparameter tuning, early stopping\n",
    "- **Test:** 15% (216 samples) - final performance evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratification:** Ensures proportional class distribution across splits using `stratify=labels` in `train_test_split()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "- Prevents data leakage (test set never seen during training)\n",
    "- Validation set enables unbiased model selection\n",
    "- Stratification maintains class balance (critical with only 180 samples per emotion)\n",

    "### 3.3 Algorithm 3: Transfer Learning with YAMNet\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Training deep networks from scratch requires massive datasets. Transfer learning leverages knowledge from models pretrained on large corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YAMNet:** MobileNet-based audio event classifier trained on AudioSet (2M YouTube clips, 521 sound classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**YAMNet Preprocessing:**\n",
    "1. Compute log-mel spectrogram (64 bins, 96 frames per 0.96s window)\n",
    "2. Pass through MobileNetV1 backbone (depthwise separable convolutions)\n",
    "3. Extract 1024-dimensional embeddings per frame\n",
    "\n",
    "**MobileNet Depthwise Separable Convolution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard convolution: $O(k^2 \\cdot C_{in} \\cdot C_{out} \\cdot H \\cdot W)$ operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Depthwise separable:\n",
    "1. **Depthwise:** Apply separate filter to each input channel: $O(k^2 \\cdot C_{in} \\cdot H \\cdot W)$\n",
    "2. **Pointwise:** $1 \\times 1$ conv combines channels: $O(C_{in} \\cdot C_{out} \\cdot H \\cdot W)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Gain:** ~9× reduction for $k=3$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer Learning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass 3-second audio through YAMNet: $\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\{e_1, ..., e_T\\}$ where $e_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1024}$\n",
    "2. Aggregate frame embeddings by averaging: $\\bar{e} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} e_t$\n",
    "3. Train lightweight classifier on frozen embeddings: $P(y | x) = \\text{softmax}(W \\cdot \\bar{e} + b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Transfer Learning Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Low-level features generalize:** Early YAMNet layers learn spectral edges, textures applicable to any audio\n",
    "2. **Mid-level features transfer:** Intermediate layers capture pitch contours, temporal patterns relevant to emotion\n",
    "3. **Domain similarity:** AudioSet includes human speech, overlapping with our emotion task\n",
    "4. **Data efficiency:** 1,440 samples insufficient for training 3.5M parameters from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning vs Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **feature extraction** (freeze YAMNet) because:\n",
    "- Limited data → risk overfitting if fine-tuning\n",
    "- Computational efficiency (one-time embedding extraction)\n",
    "- YAMNet already robust to audio variability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "YAMNet (frozen)         Input: (48000,)    → Output: (T, 1024)\n",
    "Average Pooling         (T, 1024)          → (1024,)\n",

    "Dropout(0.4)            (256,)             → (256,)\n",
